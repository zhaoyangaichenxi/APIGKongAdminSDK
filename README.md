Now, I wrote a java client to call kong's admin interface (based on the kong 1.1 version). This client can complete the registration and release of the api and the plugin binding through kong, in order to facilitate the development of the api gateway project. .
I hope that I can help you, and I hope that everyone can give us valuable advice. 
Thank you.
